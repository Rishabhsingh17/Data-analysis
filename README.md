This data analysis project explores hotel booking and movie datasets. In the hotel booking dataset, the focus is on predicting booking cancellations through data cleaning and analysis using Python, Pandas, and NumPy. For the movie dataset, a recommendation system is developed to suggest movies based on user preferences. Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn provide insights into booking patterns and movie trends.
